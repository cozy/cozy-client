[cozy-client](../README.md) / Association

# Class: Association

Associations are used by components to access related store documents that are
linked in a document. They are also responsible for building the `QueryDefinition` that is
used by the client to automatically fetch relationship data.

Hydrated documents used by components come with Association instances.

**`interface`**

**`description`**
Example: The schema defines an `author` relationship :

```js
const BOOK_SCHEMA = {
  relationships: {
     author: 'has-one'
  }
}
```

Hydrated `books` will have the `author` association instance under the `author` key.
Accessing `hydratedBook.author.data` gives you the author from the store, for example :

```json
{
  "name": "St-Exupery",
  "firstName": "Antoine",
  "_id": "antoine"
}
```

It is the responsibility of the relationship to decide how the relationship data is stored.
For example, here since we use the default `has-one` relationship, the relationship data
is stored in the `relationships` attribute of the original document (in our case here, our book
would be

```json
{
  "title": "Le petit prince",
  "relationships": {
    "author": {
      "data": {
        "doctype": "io.cozy.authors",
        "_id": "antoine"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the case of an "in-place" relationship, the relationship data is stored directly under the attribute named
by the relationship (in our case `author`). Our book would be

```json
{
    "title": "Le petit prince",
    "author": "antoine"
}
```

***

Each different type of Association may change:

*   `get raw`: how the relationship data is stored (either as per the JSON API spec or
    in a custom way)
*   `get data`: how the store documents are then fetched from the store to be added to
    the hydrated document (.data method). View components will access
    `hydratedDoc[relationshipName].data`.
*   `get query`: how to build the query to fetch related documents

## Accessors

### data

• `get` **data**(): `any`

Returns the document(s) from the store

For document with relationships stored as JSON API spec :

```js
const book = {

  relationships: {
    author: {
      data: {
        doctype: 'io.cozy.authors',
        id: 'herman'
      }
    }
  }
 }
```

`data` will be

```json
{
  "_id": "herman"
  "_type": "io.cozy.authors",
  "firstName": "herman",
  "name": "Melville"

Derived `Association`s need to implement this method.

*Returns*
