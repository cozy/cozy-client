# [30.0.0](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/compare/v29.2.0...v30.0.0) (2022-06-09)


### Features

* Throw an error when fields do not include all searched attributes ([ca72614](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/ca726142e5194a3f03bf6f0d48fc62a3e4ee2df7))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* when a `.select` is used in a query definition, it
MUST includes all the fields expressed in the selector and partial
index.
This is because we evaluate queries on the store thanks to sift,
and it requires to have all the necessary fields to evaluate the
query. If one is missing, the query will return nothing.
See this example:

```
Q('io.cozy.todos).where({date: $gt: { null}}).select(['name'])
```

When this query will be run, only the todos name will be in the store.
Then, when later evaluated in the store, sift won't find any todos with
a date ; thus it will return nothing and consider all the existing todos
should be removed from the store.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* We need to upgrade cozy-device-helper
in order to be able to run cozy-client within a node
context. So let's upgrade it.

You need to install cozy-device-helper >= 2.1.0 in
your app.

* Do not sort fields for index name ([88a1878](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/88a1878)), closes [/github.com/cozy/cozy-client/blob/ea768adecaf0dd1c52e9876bf68e86d099579a9b/packages/cozy-stack-client/src/DocumentCollection.js#L416-L418](https://github.com//github.com/cozy/cozy-client/blob/ea768adecaf0dd1c52e9876bf68e86d099579a9b/packages/cozy-stack-client/src/DocumentCollection.js/issues/L416-L418)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* in the absence of an `indexedFields` directive, the
attributes order in a `where` selector will matter to create the index.
To force an attributes order for an index, use `indexedFields`.

We used to sort the index fields to build its name, e.g.
"by_date_and_type", which allows to keep the same order independently
from their position in the `where` selector.
However, this breaks the `indexedFields` behavior: because of the sort,
the fields might be indexed in a wrong order, e.g. `[type, date]` will
actually produce a `[date, type]` index. As the order is important
in Mango, this can break some queries.

We remove this sort to be consistent with
