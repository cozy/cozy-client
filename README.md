- **Describe** your data and their **relationships**
- **Fetch** data from your Cozy and put it in a normalized **store**
- **Refresh** your React components when your data changes
- Have your data available **offline**

`cozy-client` is a convenient yet powerful way to bind `cozy-stack` queries to your (p)React components â€” but you can still benefit of it if you're not using React!
